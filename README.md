# Data Center Optimization – Final Year Project

This project focuses on optimizing energy usage in data centers by predicting resource demands using machine learning. It includes a web-based dashboard built with Flask and a trained model for real-time inference.
> ⚠️ Note: Due to GitHub file size limits, the trained model (`predictor.pkl`) and cleaned dataset (`cleaned_vmCloud_data.csv`) are not included. Contact the author to request them.

## 🚀 Features

- Machine learning model for predicting energy/resource consumption.
- Flask-based interactive web dashboard.
- Data preprocessing and feature analysis in Python.
- Modular and testable code structure.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Flask)
- HTML (Jinja2 templating)
- Git + GitHub for version control
